Key metrics for continuous testing help you gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of your testing process. Here are some important ones:

	1.	Test Coverage: Measures the percentage of your codebase tested by your suite. Higher coverage often indicates better potential for catching issues.
	2.	Test Pass Rate: The ratio of passed tests to total tests run. thing! We were discussing key metrics for continuous testing. We covered test coverage and test pass rate. Other important metrics include:
	3.	Test Execution Time: The time it takes to run your test suite. Shorter times allow for faster feedback.
	4.	Defect Density: The number of defects found per unit of code. This helps identify areas of your codebase that are error-prone.
	5.	Escaped Defects: Defects found in production, indicating the effectiveness of your testing process before release.
	6.	Build Stability: The percentage of successful builds over time, reflecting how often changes integrate smoothly.

By monitoring these metrics, you can continuously improve your testing processes and the overall quality of your software.
